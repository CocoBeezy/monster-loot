# ReactStarterKit
A React Starter Kit Scaffold that uses webpack configurations without gulp


##### Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install required node modules
2. Run `npm start` to run application on localhost:8080
3. Run `npm run build` to build the bundle.js file which is placed in the `dist` folder

- This project is using the loaders (sass, css, and style loaders) to control style. 
In order to style pages you can require a sass file in the component and it will 
receive the styling of that particular sass file. An example of this can be seen in the main.jsx
react component.
